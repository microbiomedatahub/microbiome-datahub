# Microbiome Datahub

**Microbiome Datahub** is a metagenome database focused on metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) data and metagenome projects metadata. Microbiome Datahub collects and indexes publicly available MAG data in the INSDC sequence repository.

## MAGs

**MAG** (Metagenome-Assembled Genome) is a microbial genome information that was reconstructed from metagenomic sequencing data. Most of MAG sequences are draft genome sequences of microbial strains in environments. These MAG sequences are reconstructed by assembling sequence reads (short or long reads) and binning the contigs based on sequence patterns or abundance information. These MAG sequences are important to understand microbial genomic diversity including uncultured taxa.

## MAG Data in Microbiome Datahub

- Microbiome Datahub collects publicly available MAG DNA sequence data from the INSDC sequence repository.
- All MAG sequences are reannotated using **DFAST** and **DFAST_QC** tools.
- **Version 1** contains **218,653 MAGs**.

## Interfaces

Microbiome Datahub provides three interfaces to search and obtain data:

1. **Facet-Based Metadata Search** ([Explore Here](https://mdatahub.org/genomes))
   - Search MAG data by taxonomic name, environment, MAG quality, predicted phenotype, protein function, and more.

2. **Sequence Search** ([Search Here](https://pzlast.nig.ac.jp/pzlast/mag))
   - Search MAG data by protein sequences.

3. **Download API**
   - Example: [Download Genome](https://mdatahub.org/api/dl/sequence/genome/GCA_029762495.1).
